    <p>If you're tired of the traditional spaghetti noodles with sauce poured over, give this one a try. This is the only way my family will eat their spaghetti.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>½ pound ground beef</li>
        <li>1 small onion, chopped</li>
        <li>2 (8 ounce) cans tomato sauce</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups water</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried parsley</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon black pepper</li>
        <li>½ pinch dried basil</li>
        <li>4 ounces uncooked spaghetti</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Brown ground beef with onion in a large skillet over medium heat until all pink is gone; drain.</li>
        <li>Stir in tomato sauce, water, salt, parsley, pepper, and basil; mix well. Heat until sauce boils. Break spaghetti in half and drop into the sauce a little at a time. Cover and turn to low.</li>
        <li>Cook until spaghetti is tender, approximately 20 to 25 minutes. Stir occasionally to keep from sticking together or to the pan. Add water, 1/2 to 1 cup, if it starts to dry out and noodles are not cooked.</li>
    </ol>
